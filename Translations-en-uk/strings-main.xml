    <string name="about_this_app_explanation_message">This offline notepad app has been created and is maintained by myself; the person who has written this message: Gino Basiletti.\n\nOver christmas 2018 my father was using one of the many notepad apps which are available on the Google Play Store which he was keeping all of his notes on, when one day the server that the app was backing the notes up onto was hacked and he subsequently lost all of his notes.\n\nIt is very common these days for apps to have server connectivity, so they can back data up and allow you to retrieve it across multiple devices. However, that approach obviously runs the risk of the developer of the app seeing your notes, and if the place where your notes are backed up on becomes compromised, you run the risk of your notes being seen by hackers as well - and nobody wants that!\n\nWith that in mind, I decided to create this notepad app which functions entirely offline. No server syncs or logging in; just a plain old pad of paper (so to speak).\n\nHowever, I also feel that it is important for you to have the ease of moving your notes onto other devices should you change your smart phone for example; so you are able to do so by exporting the notes (within this app) to a file, emailing it to yourself and then importing it back in from your email and onto your new device.\n\nThe point being, you are in complete control of your notes and this app will never store them anywhere but your device - and I intend on keeping it that way. Hopefully this little essay will help reassure you of that!\n\nIf you have any suggestions on how you would like this app improved (or just want to send me a \'thank you\'), please feel free to send me an email below!</string>
